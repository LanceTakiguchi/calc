## The Learning Experince
When I was making this application, I was excited to try and
develop the application via functional programming. As I kept
adding in new funtions, I quickly found my code to be a mess.
I did not fully map out how all the functions would interact
with each other. This has taught me to really preemptively
plan out all the features and to map the logical interactions
for myself before I start programming. I should map it out on
paper, then sudo code out each of the functions I plan on 
adding in.

## Web Development Utilized 
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery

## Future Features
* Application descriptions.
* Accepting keystrokes (Changing display into an input).
* Redo the javascript logic to be coded using Object Oriented Programming (OOP).
* Creating a timelapse looking spinning star background.
* Change the complete history button's UX and UI into an icon.
