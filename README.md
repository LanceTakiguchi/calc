## The Learning Experience
When I was making this application, it was exciting to use
develop the application via functional programming. As I kept
adding in new functions, I quickly found my code was a mess.
I did not fully map out how all the functions would interact
with each other. This has taught me to really preÃ«mptively
plan out all the features and to map the logical interactions
for myself before I start programming. I should map it out on
paper, then pseudocode out each of the functions I plan on 
adding in.

## Web Development Utilized 
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery

## Future Features
* Application descriptions.
* Accepting keystrokes (Changing display into an input).
* Redo the JavaScript logic in coded using Object Oriented Programming (OOP).
* Creating a time-lapse looking spinning star background.
* Change the complete history button's UX and UI into an icon for small devices.
* Change the complete history to display on the side for larger devices.
